        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Taco seasoning</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Cooked chicken</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Snack torillas</li>
            <li>Desired toppings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the shredded chicken, cheese, and taco seasoning until the cheese and chicken are coated with the seasoning.</li>
            <li> Add the sour cream and mix well. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Add more taco seasoning for extra spice or more sour cream to soothe the spiciness.</li>
            <li>Add 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken and cheese filling to the lower third of a snack tortilla. Roll up the tortilla tightly, pushing in any filling that may fall out.</li>
            <li>Brush some olive oil on the seam of the tortilla and close the taquito. Place the filled taquito seam side down in the air fryer and repeat until the tortillas and filling are finished.
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use your fingers or the back of a spoon to shape the filling on the tortilla just before rolling them up. Shape the filling into a long sausage shape, stretching to the edges of the tortilla, and then roll tightly.

                    The taquitos will be a lot more uniform and hold their shape better by doing this.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Once you have enough taquitos in your air fryer without crowding the basket (make the taquitos in two batches if needed), brush the taquitos with olive oil. Then air fry at 380 °F (180 °C) for 8 minutes and then flip the taquitos. Cook for another 8 - 10 minutes until the edges of the taquitos are crisp.</li>
            <li>Serve the taquitos with fresh guacamole, sour cream, fresh chopped cilantro and fresh pico de Gallo salsa if desired.</li>
        </ol>
